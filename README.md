# Face Recognition using PCA and ANN

This project implements a Face Recognition system using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for classification. 
The system is built in Python using libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and SciPy.

## Features

- Reads and processes a labeled face dataset
- Applies **PCA** to reduce dimensionality
- Trains an **ANN** using backpropagation
- Tests the model on unseen data and computes accuracy
- Includes experiments with varying the number of eigenvectors `k`

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn (if used for comparison)
